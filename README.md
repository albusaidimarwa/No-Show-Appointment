# Description:
This project shows statistical and graphical observations for medical appointments in Brazil downloaded from this website: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments&sa=D&ust=1532469042118000)

Several factors/characteristics that may affect the show-up and no-show decisions to the appointment is investigated by analysing 'noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016.csv' document that collects data of 110,527 medical appointments in Brazil. Each appointment includes information for 14 associated variables/characteristics, which are: PatientId, Gender, ScheduledDay, AppointmentDay, Age, Neighbourhood, Scholarship, Hypertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism, Handicap, SMS_Received, and No_Show

The program is structured to answer these questions:
1. What is the overall appointments' attendance performance of the patients?
2. How the following factors are important in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?
2.1 Gender
2.2 Age
2.3 Neighbourhood
2.4 Scholarship and SMS_Received
2.5 Health issues (Hypertension, Diabetes and Alcoholism)
3.How is the time difference between the scheduled day and appointment day affect patient's decision?
